# Matchmaking Test

This project aims to implement a basic Matchmaking logic, which is able to match players by specifying certain rules.

The Matchmaking system is in charge of finding players that satisfy specific conditions, such as minimum and maximum players, matching rules, etc.

This system is designed to be extensible and customizable, allowing to add new matching strategies, new types of rules, etc.

> ⚠️ Please note that this is a work in progress project and there are still many improvements to be made.
